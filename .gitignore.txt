# The HPC output files for some reason are not playing nice with git
# so I will ignore any folder containing them.
# The source code will still be present so this is acceptable

# Ignore any directory named "output"
output/

# Ignore "output" directories at any depth
**/output/

# Ignore any directory whose name starts with "final"
final*/

# Ignore "final*" directories at any depth
**/final*/
