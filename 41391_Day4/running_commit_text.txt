-   Added folder for Exercise #4a and subsequent code.
-   Made a mistake in not making a new folder for Exercise 5. The main code folder in Day4 also contains Exercise 5 solutions. This is acceptable as the only difference is where the inputs come from, and Exercise #4b can still be seen implemented and is clearly different from Day3.
